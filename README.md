## About

A simple library for accessing Excel sheets in C++ that uses the singleton pattern to load, store, and control 
access to Excel files.

## Prerequisites

* CMake version 3.22
* Boost version 1.75
* libzip

All the dependancies need to be installed beforehand in a location that CMake can find them with find_package (I used vcpkg on Windows).

## Test

Build and run test.cpp using the provided CMakeList
